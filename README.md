![website](assets/static/images/website.png)

## About the Project
This project aims to analyze cryptocurrency prices using machine learning techniques and also allows the user to securely sell and buy cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and ripple. By leveraging historical price data and various machine learning models, the project seeks to predict future price movements and provide insights into the trends and factors affecting cryptocurrency markets.

## Requirements
To run this project, you will need to have the following software installed on your system:
-	Coding Language:   Python.
-	Front-End			    :   HTML5 + CSS.
-	Designing:   HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
-	Data Base:   MySQL.


## Installation Instructions
Follow these steps to set up and run the project on your local machine:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   Download or clone the project repository to your local machine.

2. **Set Up the Server:**
   Download and install a server like WAMP or XAMPP on your system. Ensure that the server is running.

3. **Set Up MySQL:**
   Download and install [MySQL Server](https://wampserver.aviatechno.net) if you don't already have it. Start the MySQL service.

4. **Database Configuration:**
   - Open the project folder and locate the MySQL script file (e.g., `database.sql`).
   - Open the MySQL console and create a new database for the project.
   - Copy the contents of the MySQL script file and paste it into the MySQL console to set up the necessary database tables and data.

5. **Install Python Dependencies:**
   Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory. Run the following command to install the required Python libraries or copy and paste the dependencies to install them seperately:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
6. **Run the Project:**
   In the terminal or command prompt, navigate to the project directory and run the following command to start the server:
7. **Accessing the Website:**
   once the server stats running, it will provide a localhost link (e.g., `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`). Open this link in a web browser to access the cryptocurrency price analysis website.

## Project Structure
The project directory contains the following key files and folders:
- `database.sql`: MySQL script to set up the database.
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python dependencies.
- `manage.py`: Django management script to run the server.
- Other project files and folders related to the Django application.

## Usage
After setting up and running the project, you can use the web interface to perform various tasks such as:
- Sell and Buy Cryptocurrencies
- Viewing historical cryptocurrency prices.
- Analyzing price trends and patterns.
- Predicting future price movements using machine learning models.

## Conclusion
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of cryptocurrency prices using machine learning techniques and also at the same time provides an interface for buying and selling cryptocurrencies securely. By following the installation instructions, you can set up the project on your local machine and explore the various features and insights it offers.
